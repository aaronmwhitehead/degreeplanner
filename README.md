# TAMU MEEN Degree Planner
This is a degree planner that TAMU students can use as an alternative to the one on HOWDY.    
Currently only works with test data from the Department of Mechanical Engineering.   
Many design queues were borrowed from Jake Leland's [Aggie Scheduler](http://www.aggiescheduler.com/) page.
